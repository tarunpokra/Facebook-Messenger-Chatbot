# Facebook-Messenger-Chatbot

This is a machine learning Chatbot I created using the Facebook/Meta Developer platform, and coded using back-end through node.js. I implemented the machine learning
    tactics through the usage of DialogFlow from Google. 
The AI Chatbot can be asked various questions upon being programmed to learn responses as a human being would, through DialogFlow.
